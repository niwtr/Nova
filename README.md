# Nova -- C++ Implementation of A* Algorithm
This is originally an assignment project of lesson "Machine Intelligence" in Beijing University of Posts & Communications (BUPT) but now I'm making it open-source. Be happy to hack.

In this software, we provide:
* A C++ implementation of A* search algorithm that comes in light-weight, separate API. It's quite efficient and easy to use. See folder **A*API**.
* A Lisp implementation of A* search algorithm that is originally developed by Peter Novig in his fancy book PAIP.
* A demo for our C++ implementation of A* algorithm. See folder **/nova_maze**.

## Build
- C++ A* API: Compile with **-std=c++14** turned on.
- Demo: Build with Qt 5.5+. Tested well on Mac OS X 10.11. 
## License 
MIT for C++ A* API, LGPL v3 for Demo.

Hack and glory awaits!
